In day 1 we have learnt that what happens ,when a user types some url in the browser.
   1)Browser send request to DNS Server which maps the domain name to IP Address and returns the IP Address .
   2)IP Address is received by CDN Edge and it sends the updated version of data to the browser
   3)We also came to know ,what is Java Backend people's work.
   4)And also about request and response.
